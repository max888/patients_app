#Patients App

Used as an apps so a doctor can add patients details to a table.

Current issues:
Can't add D.O.B and Note to new patients.

  I haven't been able to implement localhost as the server for the backbone app and instead followed a similar example at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZSjvWtUxYk&list=LL2YA0cc_Qs-z1ACPFbypsRQ&index=2 which uses http://backbonejs-beginner.herokuapp.com as the URL.
  
  I think this may be the reason I cannot add the D.O.B and Note to the User(Patient) model.
